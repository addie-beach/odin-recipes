            <li>Preheat your oven to 425 degrees.</li>
            <li>Using your hands, cover the sweet potatoes with the oil and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt.

            <li>While the sweet potatoes roast, make the salsa.

            <li>Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven and, once cool, scoop the flesh out with a spoon.
                Mash the flesh with 1/8 teaspoon of salt and a generous amount of black pepper until smooth.</li>
            <li>Transfer the sweet potato mixture to a bowl and spoon the salsa over top.
                Serve hot.</li>
